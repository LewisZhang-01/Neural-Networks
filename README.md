# Neural-Networks

This project is to build a multi-layer perceptron MLP, but without using any of the available libraries for neural networks/connectors/machine learning etc. It is written in a Python Jupyter notebook because it is concise, convenient to annotate, and a good record of the training process. 

It contain following files:


* **Assignment_Code_Zhi_Zhang.ipynb** <br/> Contains all the code to build the MLP and test and visualise analysis.<br/>
* **Assignment\_Code\_Zhi\_Zhang.html** <br/> A HTML version of ipynb file.<br/>
* **Assignment\_Report\_Zhi\_Zhang.pdf** <br/> A report with the description of the experiments I have conducted and the results obtained.<br/>
* **XOR\_log.txt** <br/> Contain error and results during training and test for XOR question.<br/>
* **SIN\_log.txt** <br/> Contain error and results during training and test for SIN question.<br/>
* **Letter\_recognition\_log.txt** <br/> Contain error and results during training and test for letter recognition question.<br/>
* **Rank\_log.txt** <br/> Log data on how the accuracy of letter recognition changes when hidden layers and epochs are changed.<br/>
* **letter-recognition.data** <br/> Data set for MLP training on letter recognition.<br/>
